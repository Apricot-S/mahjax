class State(abc.ABC):
    """Base state class of all Mahjax game environments. Basically an immutable (frozen) dataclass.
    A basic usage is generating via `Env.init`:

        state = env.init(jax.random.PRNGKey(0))

    and `Env.step` receives and returns this state class:

        state = env.step(state, action, key)

    Serialization via `flax.struct.serialization` is supported.
    There are 6 common attributes over all games:

    Attributes:
        current_player (Array): id of agent to play.
            Note that this does NOT represent the turn (e.g., black/white in Go).
            This ID is consistent over the parallel vmapped states.
        rewards (Array): the `i`-th element indicates the intermediate reward for
            the agent with player-id `i`. If `Env.step` is called for a terminal state,
            the following `state.rewards` is zero for all players.
        terminated (Array): denotes that the state is terminal state. Note that
            some environments (e.g., Go) have an `max_termination_steps` parameter inside
            and will terminate within a limited number of states (following AlphaGo).
        truncated (Array): indicates that the episode ends with the reason other than termination.
            Note that current Mahjax environments do not invoke truncation but users can use `TimeLimit` wrapper
            to truncate the environment. In Mahjax environments, some MinAtar games may not terminate within a finite timestep.
            However, the other environments are supposed to terminate within a finite timestep with probability one.
        legal_action_mask (Array): Boolean array of legal actions. If illegal action is taken,
            the game will terminate immediately with the penalty to the palyer.
